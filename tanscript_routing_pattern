Hello everyone

In this video we will talk about another ai workflow pattern
e.g routing pattern.

.If parallel workflows were about doing multiple things at once,
 routing is about making smart decisions about who should handle what task
 
 What is the Routing Pattern?

Think of routing like a smart receptionist at a busy office building. When visitors arrive, the receptionist doesn't send everyone to the same person. Instead, they ask a few questions and then direct each visitor to the right specialist - legal questions go to the legal department, technical issues go to IT, and financial matters go to accounting.

Routing classifies user input and directs it to specialized agents (like separate agents for Gmail, Calendar, or Slack), minimizing the scope of responsibility for any single LLM.
